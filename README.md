Code for the paper - "Gate-Based Initialization and Fidelity in Correlated Open Quantum Systems"
This repository contains the core numerical implementation supporting the results presented in the paper. Specifically, it includes:

- Instantaneous_pulse: evolution function under the instantaneous gate limit;
- Finite_Gate_Withingate: evolution functionduring the finite-duration gate;
- Finite_Gate_Postgate: evolution function after the finite gate is applied.

An example script is provided to illustrate how to use these modules in practice. All simulations and analysis shown in the manuscript are based on these codes.
